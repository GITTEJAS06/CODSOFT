# Task 2:- Credit Card Fraud Detection
   - Objective: Identify fraudulent transactions in credit cards.
   - Steps:
1. Data Collection: One can use the data set on credit card transactions, which is labeled for fraudulent and genuine transactions.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle class imbalance, scale features, or drop unnecessary columns.
3. Model Training: By using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks.
4. Evaluation: Model performance may be evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
5. Prediction: Use the model to predict fraud in new transactions.


# Task 3:- Customer Churn Prediction
   - Objective: Calculate the propensity that a customer will choose to end a subscription-based business or service.
   - Steps:
1. Data Collection: Get information about customers, their demography, and usage behavior.
2. Data Preprocessing: Treat missing values; encode categorical variables; scale numerical data.
3. Model Training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
4. Evaluation: Model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Prediction: Use the trained model to predict customer Churn.


# Task 4:- Spam SMS Detection
   - Objective: The task is to classify whether an SMS message is a spam or a genuine message.
   - Steps:
1. Data Collection: The model will be trained on a dataset consisting of SMS messages as spam or ham.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing of the text data by tokenization and then vectorization with TF-IDF or word embeddings.
3. Model Training: These can be combined with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.
4. Evaluation: Check the model for accuracy and other relevant metrics like precision and recall.
5. Prediction: Use the trained model to predict whether new SMS messages are spam or not.
